## ðŸ“– About the Project

**Skybook** is a static HTML project designed as a flight booking platform landing page. The primary goal of the project is to showcase a visually engaging and user-friendly interface for an airline or travel booking company.

It features:
- A basic flight booking form
- Promotional visuals and animated banners
- A structured layout with a navigation bar and footer
- Contact information, social media icons, and certification badges

This project serves as a front-end prototype for a real-world travel website and demonstrates the structure and layout of a typical flight booking portal.

Itâ€™s an ideal starting point for:
- Beginners exploring HTML & CSS
- Students building UI prototypes
- Anyone interested in front-end web design for travel or airline platforms
